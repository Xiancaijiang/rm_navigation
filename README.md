# RM-SIMULATION

Learn navigation algorithms through codinghttps://github.com/Xiancaijiang/RM_SIMULATION.git

## 1.pb_RM_simulation_launch

- bringup_real.launch.pu
- bringup_sim.launch.pu

launch: The most important concept is the **action** .

To understand the code in detail, my habit is to learn the entire code architecture through launch file.



## 2.rm_localization

- point_lio

	To explain the key parts of Point_Lio algorithm

- FAST_LIO

	To explain the key parts of FAST_LIO algorithm

- ICP_registration

	To explain the key parts of icp_registration algorithm
